The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanum
tuberosum. The word "potato" may refer either to the plant itself or to the
edible tuber. In the Andes, where the species is indigenous, some other
closely related species are cultivated. Potatoes were introduced to Europe in
the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish.
